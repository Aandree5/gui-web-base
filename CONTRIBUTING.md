# Contributing to gui-web-base

We’re excited that you want to contribute! This document outlines how to engage with the project and community in a respectful and productive way.

## 🐛 Creating Good Issues

- **Search first**: Check existing issues and discussions before opening a new one.
- **Be specific**: Include steps to reproduce, expected vs. actual behavior, and environment details.
- **Minimal examples**: When reporting bugs, providing the smallest reproducible case, if possible, helps to track down the issue.

## 🔀 Submitting Pull Requests

- **Branching**: Create a feature branch from `main` (e.g., `feat/add-logging`).
- **Conventional Commits**: All commits must follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:
  - `feat:` for new features
  - `fix:` for bug fixes
  - `docs:` for documentation changes
  - `chore:`, `refactor:`, `test:`, etc.
- **Small and focused**: Keep PRs limited to a single concern.
- **Linked issues**: Reference related issues in your PR description (e.g. `fixes #42`, `closes #42`, `ref #42`).
